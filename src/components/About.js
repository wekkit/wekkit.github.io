          My name's Keith and I like to build things. I'm a UX/interaction
          designer by training, now a software engineer by trade. I have a
          passion for building all kinds of media - from game design to writing
          to film to interaction design.
          <br />
          <br />I love creating design systems that scale and accessible
          interfaces that delight - not just for the users that interact with
          them, but also for the designers that leverage them and the developers
          that deploy them.
