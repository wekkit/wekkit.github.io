        My name's Keith and I like to build things. I'm a UX/Interaction designer by training, now a web developer by trade.  I have a passion for building all kinds of media - from game design to writing to film to interaction design.<br/><br/>
        I’m fuelled by a love for learning and a constant desire to become better at what I do, and my love for technology has led me to learning the craft of programming and developing web technologies.
